This project is a personal practice website built using HTML and CSS, inspired by a demo website. It is designed to improve my web development skills and learn modern web design techniques.

## Features

Styled using custom CSS.
Integrated images for better visual appeal.
Inspiration
The website design takes inspiration from a demo website. While certain elements are similar, Iâ€™ve implemented my own structure and styling to create a unique version.

## Images
Images used in this project were sourced from a demo website for educational purposes. If this project is to be used publicly, I will replace these images with royalty-free or appropriately licensed alternatives.

## Future Improvements
Replace demo images with original or royalty-free assets.
Add JavaScript functionality for interactivity.
Optimize for better performance and accessibility.
